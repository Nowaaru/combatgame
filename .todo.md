- [ ] Project Management

  - [ ] Create a rust-based CLI for the project to help
        users pick and choose what features they want to use.

  - [ ] Create an object that fallbacks to default
        RemoteEvent / RemoteFunction handlers to allow
        for more developer control over events and functions.

- [ ] Flamework

  - [ ] Make flamework decorators for the project to make
        entities easier to create and manage.

  - [ ] Add more lifecycle events

  - [ ] Implement more event middleware for both development
        and debugging purposes.

    - [ ] Make macros for client-sided server-generated attribute
          acquisition (for example, getting a player from a participant id)
          and apply it to the codebase.

- [ ] Framework

  - [ ] Make an extensible Effect class that allows developers to
        define a series of other extensible mesh creation and transformation
        classes across a read-only timeline.

- [ ] Debug

  - [ ] Implement a debug system to help with debugging
        and testing.

    - [ ] Implement a debug window that can track
          entities, their components, and specific values.
