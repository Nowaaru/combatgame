    ! Complete Arena Implementation
        x Fix bug that prevents the player from spawning into the game
    x ArenaLike is not correct.
        ArenaLike should be an object that contains the arena's properties.
        and can allow the game to generate an arena from the object.

        The current ArenaLike should turn into a layout that can be used to
        change the Arena's configuration i.e. Origin.

    - Implement hypermobility for the player
        - Implement air-dashing

            On the Offensive:

                The character will be able to chase-dash towards
                the direction they are holding. Keyboard players will automatically chase towards 
                the target's direction as long as the general direction is held, meanwhile
                controller players will have to precisely input the direction they want to dash
                in order to chase properly.

                A downward chase-dash will cinematically ground the player with a dust effect and
                a small shockwave. This will be used to cancel aerial momentum and allow the user to
                reset their air-movement resources.

                A backward chase-dash will vanish the player and reappear behind the target. This
                will be used to dodge attacks and reposition the player as projectiles do not disappear
                if the player is hit.

                An upward chase-dash will vanish the player and reappear above the target. This
                will be used to dodge attacks and reposition the player as projectiles do not disappear
                if the player is hit.
